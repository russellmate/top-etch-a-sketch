## What I Learned

This project tested my ability to take user input and create/modify DOM elements from that input. Again I put to use my knowledge of funcions and loops, however I also worked with some conditionals and more complex DOM methods than in the prvious project.

I took the time to style this project as I felt it was important in order to fully appreciate the features that I made.
